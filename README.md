# FEA-Based-Damage-Prediction-in-Composite-Wing-Box-using-Hashin-Failure-Criteria-in-Abaqus
Modeled a carbon-epoxy composite wing box with added ribs using layered shell elements in Abaqus

Applied all three Hashin failure criteria (fiber tension, fiber compression, and matrix failure) to predict damage initiation and progression under axial compression

Simulated structural response under combined loading conditions including concentrated engine force, pressure, and distributed lift
